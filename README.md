# Trade Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains analysis of trading behavior patterns across financial markets. 
The project applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to understand, model, and predict trading activities based on historical market data.

## Research Questions
- How do Hidden Orders and Canceled Orders differ by Market Capitalization?
- How do Hidden Orders and Canceled Orders affect whether a company beats its earning prediction.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes financial market data including:
- Historical price and volume data
- Order book information
- Trader-specific transaction records
- Market volatility indicators
- Macroeconomic signals

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
   - Acquisition of financial market data
   - Cleaning and normalization of time series data
   - Feature engineering to capture relevant market dynamics

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualization of trading patterns
   - Statistical analysis of market behaviors
   - Identification of anomalies and regime changes

3. **Modeling Approaches**:
   - Time series analysis of trading activity
   - Agent-based modeling of market participants
   - Machine learning models for behavior prediction
   - Network analysis of trading relationships

4. **Validation & Testing**:
   - Out-of-sample testing on historical data
   - Performance metrics for predictive accuracy
   - Robustness checks across different market conditions

## Key Findings
- [Summary of project findings will be added as research progresses]
- [Insights into trader behavior patterns]
- [Effectiveness of predictive models]
- [Market condition influences on trading activities]

## Repository Structure
- `/data/`: Contains datasets used in the analysis (or scripts to fetch them)
- `/notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks documenting the analytical process
- `/models/`: Implementation of trading behavior models
- `/visualization/`: Scripts and outputs for data visualization
- `/reports/`: Detailed findings and research documentation

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Financial analysis libraries (e.g., pyfolio, zipline)
- Machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)

## Usage
```python
# Example code for using the trading behavior models
from models.behavior_predictor import TradingBehaviorModel

# Initialize model
model = TradingBehaviorModel()

# Train model on historical data
model.train(historical_data)

# Predict future trading behavior
predictions = model.predict(current_market_conditions)
```

## Future Work
- Expansion to additional asset classes
- Integration of alternative data sources
- Development of real-time trading behavior monitoring
- Comparative analysis across different market regimes
- Application to trading strategy development
